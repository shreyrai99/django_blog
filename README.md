## Description

There was a need of a platform which was solely dedicated to education and where students could share posts, asks doubts, share study material all at one place and so while I was learning Django I decided to make a website where student community could do so. Following are the features of the website:

* **Users can create, update and delete posts**
* **Study Material section for uploading books,PDFs, PPTs etc**
* **Section for asking your doubts and vote on questions posted by others in the "Doubt & Problem Centre"**
* **The class monitor supervises the activities and acts as the "super-user" to ensure there is no unscrupulous activity**
* **Safe, secure and reliable with added security features like CSRF Protection**
* **Personalized Profiles of each user with option to update profile pictures and other details**
* **Contribution points for active users**

## Technologies Used

* Django 
* Python
* HTML 
* CSS  

## Future Scope

I will add a Quiz application in this website where users can give mock quizes to improve their learning ability and thus test their skills.
